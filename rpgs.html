    <h1>Table Top Role Playing Games</h1>
    <p>There are several Table Top Role playing games (TTRPGs) that I run and played. </p>
    <p> The first TTRPG I played was Dungeons and dragons (D&D) 3.5 but I haven't played that since 2014 when 5e was released, I am not yet familiar with the 2024 update because I prefer to play indy RPGs.</p>

        A role plaing game is a form of colabrative storytelling, 
        where the players inhabit the charicters and decide what they do.
        The rules or mechanics are a method for deciding what happens when the players try to do things.
        There is often a Gamesmaster, or Dungeon master in D&D, who runs the game, enforces* the rules, and describes the world.

        Not all TTRPGs
