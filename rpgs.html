    <h1>Table Top Role Playing Games</h1>
    <p>There are several Table Top Role playing games <a href="glossary.html">(TTRPGs)</a> that I run and played. </p>
    <p> The first TTRPG I played was Dungeons and dragons <a href="glossary.html">(D&D)</a> 3.5 but I haven't played that since 2014 when 5e was released, I am not yet familiar with the 2024 update because I prefer to play indy RPGs.</p>
    <p>
        A role plaing game is a form of colabrative storytelling, 
        where the players inhabit the charicters and decide what they do.
        The rules or mechanics are a method for deciding what happens when the players try to do things.
        There is often a Gamesmaster <a href="glossary.html">(GM)</a>, 
        or Dungeon master <a href="glossary.html">(DM)</a> in <a href="glossary.html">D&D</a>,
         who runs the game, enforces* the rules, and describes the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not all TTRPGs have a game master for example, Alice is Missing, And Fiasco are both run without a GM.

        *Or not, often a GM will bend the rules to allow for the "Rule of Cool" or if they think something makes sense to work differently.
